# TODO
# Guidebook Entry to put on Cassette Players/Tapes (Add to the base of the tapes and the player so the "?" shows up.)
# Rename all of the entities to not include RMC (Make sure this is reflected in the CS side aswell).
# Need to add the custom cassette + player to loadouts, the library vendor, and the quickthreads
# Create Umbra Cassettes (Do this last?)
  # We can port the RMC Cassettes but I don't know how fitting those actually are.
# CS Check
  # RMCStorageEjectHandItemEvent doesn't exist. Causing a build error. I don't think we need this? We can probably use one that exists with wizden.
  # Probably good to go through and add summaries to comps and some of the functions.
# Maybe instead of the actions we make them verbs on the cassette? Probably make a poll.
# There are so many sprites for this, I wouldn't mind trimming them down. Discuss?
  # Maybe resprite?

# On RMC, this file path is: Resources/Prototypes/_RMC14/Actions/Marines/marine_cassette_actions.yml
