  name: Damien's nanoweave mantle
  description: A multi piece cloak that can be folded up into a mantle.  Its made out of nanoweave in traditional colours, often worn by Avali across the Illuminate. The fabric is intricately weaved down to the atomic level, making it incredibly strong and durable. A large dream catcher with some sync crystals attached to it hang from the right shoulder. Wearing it feels like the embrace of a forgotten loved one.
