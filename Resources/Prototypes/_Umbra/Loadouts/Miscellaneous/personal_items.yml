# TO ADD A NEW PERSONAL ITEM LOADOUT, you MUST do the following:
#
# 1. Create a LOADOUT (type: loadout) with a PersonalItemLoadoutEffect
#    that refers to your character. Punctuation MUST match EXACTLY.
#    ID: same as the personal item entity.
# 2. Create a STARTING GEAR (type: startingGear) that equips the item.
#    If the item fits in a backpack, use the `back:` slot. Otherwise,
#    use the `inhand:` slot.
#    ID: same as the personal item entity.
# 3. One loadout and one starting gear per item.
# 4. One item per starting gear.
# 5. Add the loadout to every applicable LOADOUT GROUP in loadout_groups.yml
#    (in the parent folder of this file).
