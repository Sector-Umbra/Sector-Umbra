book-text-jaytau = The book begins with a lengthy prologue informing the reader of how long a supposed battle between the so-called 'rationalist' and 'empiricist' sides have fought over the description reality of the universe, with the author claiming his best attempt to remain unbiased analyzing both perspectives.

        After the prologue is finished, the book devolves into a very convoluted analysis between the metaphysical, ontological and epistemological propositions of the rationalist and empiricist sides, comparing each side's arguments on a variety of themes and existencial questions.

        The book enters a few digressions and is fairly illegible due to both the themes talked about and the way the book expresses these in a roundabout way, using very specific and somewhat inaccessible language.
