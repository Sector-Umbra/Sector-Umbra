book-text-emiko = The Prophet of Pyrimov is a folktale from the planet Pyrimov, recounting the rise of Sasaki, a young girl whose visions of a future free from the oppressive reign of the current leaders. Sasaki's ability to see beyond the present is symbolized by her connection to Pyrelis, a purple flower that is the only bloom to survive in their arid environment.

        Sasaki begins as a quiet, isolated figure, but when the leaders' cruelty grows too severe, she dares to speak of her visions. Her words ignite a spark, and soon, a band of rebels gathers under her. As Sasaki gains followers, they begin to unravel the hold of the tyrants. But the road to revolution is not without sacrifice. Sasaki navigates internal struggles, the weight of expectations, and the brutal retaliation of the leaders.

        The margins of the story are filled to the brim with small, scratchy notes that are barely legible.
