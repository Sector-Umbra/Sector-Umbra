book-text-michaels-card = It's a worn and faded card that's been folded for safekeeping, its ripped edges held together with strips of tape.

        The front is covered in cute graphics of space carp. The top says in bold: [bold] HAPPY FATHERS DAY![/bold]

        Inside the card is a pen drawing of two stick figures holding hands.
