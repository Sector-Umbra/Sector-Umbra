# Reporting a security vulnerability
You can report a security vulnerability through Discord. Upon first contact on Discord, and when required, an alternative means of communication will be set up.

If you want to contact us through Discord, you can **privately** message `@tsjiptsjip`.

**Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give you permission to do so**.

GPG keys for secure communication can be found here: [https://github.com/TsjipTsjip.gpg](https://github.com/TsjipTsjip.gpg)
